# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `clocks-band` mod: a band above the prompt listing every Bash command, MCP call and subagent that has run for 5 seconds or more, with elapsed time and, where one exists, its limit (a Bash call's own timeout) or an advisory warn time you set for subagents and MCP calls, marked OVER past it. Watch-only in this first version: it never changes, delays or stops a call; limits and a kill key wait on a live probe of what a mod can stop.
- `model-bakeoff` skill: runs a custom subagent's test cases on Haiku, Sonnet and Opus through `claude -p`, applies a stated pass rule (each case passes in 2 of 3 runs, 90% of all runs), recommends the cheapest passing model by measured cost, and after your yes writes the pinned model ID into the agent's `model` field with a backup and undo. Read-only by default; agents that can write or run commands need an explicit opt-in. Keeps a results file so a later run re-tests only the models that changed. Custom subagents only; not yet run against a real session.
- `local-answer-router` mod: answers a short list of trivial questions (what branch am I on, what changed, last commit, diff summary, did the last test pass) from git and from the last test run it watched, with no model tokens. Matches only whole messages from a fixed phrase list, labels every answer `[local, no tokens]`, lets `ask:` force the model, and falls through to the model on any doubt. It only reads.
- `mcp-fixer tasks` and `mcp-fixer bench` (third of three parts): `tasks` has a model write test requests for each tool into an editable file, and `bench` runs them against the original and the patched tool list (as `wrap` serves it) through `claude -p` or the Anthropic API, then reports both accuracies with 95% intervals, a paired comparison, token sizes and a sample-size-aware verdict (`worse`, `no drop detected` or `inconclusive`). It can detect a drop but does not show a patch improves tool selection, and it has not been run against a real server yet.
- `mcp-fixer patch` and `mcp-fixer wrap` (second of three parts): `patch` writes an editable patch file from the lint findings (enums found in descriptions and trimmed long descriptions are filled in and flagged for review; everything else becomes a todo), and `wrap` runs a stdio proxy in front of a real MCP server that shows the client the patched tool definitions, renames included, while forwarding every other message byte for byte. It never enforces an enum or changes calls, serves a tool unpatched when the server has changed it, and makes no claim yet that a patch improves tool selection.
- `mcp-fixer` MCP server tool (first of three parts): `python -m mcp_fixer score` reads an MCP server's tool list, from a spawned stdio server or a saved JSON file, and prints a deterministic lint score from 0 to 100 with per-tool scores and findings (missing or bloated descriptions, undescribed or untyped parameters, values listed in prose that should be enums, generic or inconsistent names, and tool-count and token-size limits). Read-only: it never calls a tool. The patcher and the accuracy proof come next.
- `subagent-meter` mod: a live status line showing how much of your session's tokens go to subagents (a share of output tokens and a share of all tokens, side by side) and which agent type uses the most. Tokens only, session scope, never changes a turn. The toolkit's first mod.
- `schedule-doctor` skill: before you schedule a Claude task it lints the prompt (likely tools to pre-approve, a time guard against stale catch-up runs, time-relative wording) and checks whether your machine keeps awake; afterwards it classifies why a run did not fire (permission halt, slept through, late catch-up, failed, or not enough data). Covers Desktop scheduled tasks, Claude Code crons and cloud routines.
- `subagent-tax-auditor` skill: reads your local session transcripts, shows which subagent types used up your quota (per type and model, with fixed context per spawn), recommends cheaper models, edits custom agents' `model` after confirmation with a backup and undo, and compares usage before and after.
- `rule-promoter` skill: turns the enforceable rules in CLAUDE.md into hooks (protected paths, blocked commands, banned content, must-pass-before-stopping), proves each rule blocks a violation, and installs them into `.claude/settings.json` after confirmation.

### Changed
- The repo and marketplace are now `narens-claude-toolkit` (was `narens-claude-skills`), and the tooling handles skills, mods and MCP servers. If you installed a plugin from the old marketplace, run `/plugin marketplace remove narens-claude-skills`, then `/plugin marketplace add NarenDawar/narens-claude-toolkit`, then `/plugin install <plugin-name>@narens-claude-toolkit`. Plugin names, versions and behavior are unchanged.

### Fixed
- `subagent-tax-auditor` 0.1.1: snapshot files and backup records are written with LF line endings on Windows; the date filters say they use UTC dates; a run that switches models counts as one spawn, on the model it started with.
- `rule-promoter` 0.1.3: a `settings.json` with comments or trailing commas is still refused, and the error now says Claude Code treats those as errors too.
- `rule-promoter` 0.1.2: shell `#` comments and the body of a heredoc that is not fed to a shell or interpreter (such as a commit message) no longer trigger or excuse a command rule; patterns with a repeated group that repeats (`(a+)+`) are refused because they can hang the hook; all stop checks share one 280-second budget, with the rest skipped and a warning when it runs out; command output in a legacy console code page is decoded instead of replaced.
- `rule-promoter` 0.1.1: a deny message names the matched path or command; rules with a non-boolean `enabled`, globs that could never match (`[ab]`, `{a,b}`, leading `./` or `/`) or a `timeout_seconds` above 280 are refused instead of silently misbehaving; very deeply nested tool input is still checked; the settings helper keeps Windows launcher paths intact, keeps file permissions, writes through a symlinked `settings.json`, and reports a write failure as a clean error; the force-push example also catches `-fu` and `+main`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- `decision-journal` 0.1.2: `--confidence 1` explains it was read as 100%; `stats --tag` matches entries logged by 0.1.0 (tags are casefolded when compared); the OS error names the file that actually failed; an estimate given `--confidence` reports the real mistake; a missing subcommand lists the commands; `grade`'s `result` line is documented as success-only; `grade`'s result line prints whole numbers from older logs as `3`, not `3.0`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- `comprehension-check` 0.1.1: grades only the current question when you answer ahead, gives a summary and stops when you say stop, drops a question your own fix already answered, re-asks flagged topics on a retake, scales the question count for medium changes; README example, line range and slash form corrected.
- `decision-journal` 0.1.1: unreadable or unwritable logs give a clean error, concurrent sessions can no longer lose entries (lock file), duplicate ids are reported by line, `70%` and `0.7` are accepted as confidence, `grade` prints a computed result line, tiny or odd numbers are handled, small estimate slices carry no verdict, symlinked and drive-root paths work, README example now shows the real report.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added
- Repo scaffolding: plugin marketplace, skill template, validator, catalog generator, CI.
- `comprehension-check` skill: quizzes you on the code Claude wrote this session and flags the parts you could not maintain.
- `decision-journal` skill: log predictions about dev decisions, grade them later, and see where you are overconfident (JSONL log plus a standard-library calibration script).
